Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis.
 According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across
 the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes is a disease caused due
 to the increase level of blood glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of
 frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading cause
 of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke. When we eat, our body turns
 food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas is supposed to release insulin. Insulin
 serves as a key to open our cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow us to use the glucose
 for energy. But with diabetes, this system does not work. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the
 most commonforms ofthedisease, but there are also other kinds, such as gestational diabetes,
 which occurs during pregnancy, as well as other forms. Machine learning is an emerging
 scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience.
 The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for
 a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning
 techniques. The algorithms like K nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Random forest, Support
 vector machine and Decision tree are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the
 algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting
 the diabetes
